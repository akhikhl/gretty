Gretty version 1.1.7 is out and immediately available at github, bintray, maven central and gradle plugin portal!

Gretty version 1.1.7 introduces new feature: [redirect filter](http://akhikhl.github.io/gretty-doc/Redirect-filter.html). 
The feature is completely independent from the rest of Gretty and can be deployed as part of WAR-file.
