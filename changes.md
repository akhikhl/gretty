#### Version 1.2.1

Gretty version 1.2.1 introduces the following changes:

1. Inheriting logging options to generated product is fixed ([issue #152](https://github.com/akhikhl/gretty/issues/152)).

spring-boot: 1.1.9.RELEASE -> 1.2.3.RELEASE
spring-loaded: 1.2.1.RELEASE -> 1.2.3.RELEASE
```

* Fix for class reloading with WAR tasks. Now if some class is changed (recompiled), the web-application restarts as expected.
* Fix for the bug: slf4j/logback libraries are excluded from webapps packed into Gretty product.

#### Version 1.1.9

Gretty version 1.1.9 introduces full isolation of it's own logging system (slf4j/logback)
from the constituent web-applications. Now web-applications are free to use any logging system -
Gretty does not interfere and does not force logback to be used.

Also Gretty 1.1.9 solves problems with farm configuration when farm is defined in the parent project
and web-applications are defined in child projects.

At last Gretty 1.1.9 includes upgrades of the following components to their latest versions:

tomcat8: 8.0.15 -> 8.0.20

#### Version 1.1.8

Gretty version 1.1.8 introduces new parameters for [fine-tuning of debugging tasks](http://akhikhl.github.io/gretty-doc/Debugger-support.html#_fine_tuning).

#### Version 1.1.4

- New feature: [inplaceMode property](http://akhikhl.github.io/gretty-doc/Gretty-configuration.html#_inplacemode), when assigned to "hard", instructs Gretty to serve files directly from src/main/webapp, bypassing file copy on change.

- Enhancement in Jetty/Windows-specific lifecycle: useFileMappedBuffer is set to false for all Gretty tasks, so that Jetty does not lock css/js files.

#### Version 1.1.1

- Changed the default value of [managedClassReload property](http://akhikhl.github.io/gretty-doc/Gretty-configuration.html#_managedclassreload) to false. Please set it to true, if you need springloaded integration.

#### Version 1.1.0

- New feature: [generation of self-contained runnable products](http://akhikhl.github.io/gretty-doc/Product-generation.html).

- New feature: support of tomcat-specific [server.xml](http://akhikhl.github.io/gretty-doc/tomcat.xml-support.html) and [context.xml](http://akhikhl.github.io/gretty-doc/tomcat-context.xml-support.html) - in Gretty tasks as well as in generated products.

- New properties for finer control of hot deployment feature: recompileOnSourceChange, reloadOnClassChange, reloadOnConfigChange, reloadOnLibChange. See more information at [hot deployment](http://akhikhl.github.io/gretty-doc/Hot-deployment.html)

- Upgraded Gretty to Jetty 7.6.15.v20140411, Jetty 9.2.1.v20140609, Tomcat 8.0.9 and Spring Boot 1.1.4.RELEASE. Note that Gretty *was not* upgraded to Jetty 8.1.15.v20140411 because this release brings some strange errors not reproducible with other releases of Jetty 8.
