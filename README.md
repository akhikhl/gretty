Gretty is a feature-rich gradle plugin for running web-apps on embedded servlet containers.
It supports Jetty versions 7, 8 and 9, Tomcat versions 7 and 8, multiple web-apps and many more.
It wraps servlet container functions as convenient Gradle tasks and configuration DSL.

A complete list of Gretty features is available in [feature overview](http://akhikhl.github.io/gretty-doc/Feature-overview.html).

#### :star: What's new

- Gretty 1.1.7 is out and immediately available at [Gradle plugin portal](http://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.akhikhl.gretty),

See also: [complete list of changes](changes.md) in this and previous versions.

#### Documentation

You can learn about all Gretty features in [online documentation](http://akhikhl.github.io/gretty-doc/).

#### System requirements

Gretty requires JDK7 or JDK8 and Gradle 1.10 or newer (Gradle 2.1 is highly recommended!).

Gretty also works on JDK6, although Jetty support is limited to versions 7 and 8 in this case. This is due to the fact that Jetty 9 was compiled against JDK7 and it's bytecode is not compatible with JDK6.

#### Availability

Gretty is an open-source project and is freely available in sources as well as in compiled form.

All releases of Gretty are available at [Bintray](https://bintray.com/akhikhl/maven/gretty/view) and [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22org.akhikhl.gretty%22) under the group 'org.akhikhl.gretty'.
